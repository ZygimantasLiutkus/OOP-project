# Opening
*Check that everybody is present, and once that's the case do the stand-up meeting (everyone gives a short update on their activities of the previous week).*

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action

 - Distribute the tasks for the upcoming week
 - Discuss the following with the TA:
   - Code of Conduct feedback
   - Backlog feedback
   - API endpoints
   - Good GitLab practices

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*
 - For the feedback for the HCI assignment, do we need to cooperate with one group or can we individually ask students from different groups?

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Session notes
 - *Write these during the session*

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
