# Opening

*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda

*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action

##Progress check:

- How close are we to achieving the minimum expectation from the course?
- Does anyone have any remaining issues from previous sprints?

##Planning

- Currently, there are 19 solved issues
- There are still 6 "MUST HAVE" issues from previous weeks
- Set stricter deadlines for each sprint
- Everyone should have their issue(s) merged into Development at the end of the week

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)

*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should
implement.*

# Any other business

*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2),
he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA

- Will we receive the GitInspector data after every week?

# Question round

*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing

- Don't forget about this week's deadlines to submit the issues
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
