## Tips / tops round

- Remember the CPR model:
    - Content
    - Process
    - Relationship
- Remember how to give feedback
    - Observation of behavior
    - Consequence and feeling
    - Desired situation or behavior
- Remember how to receive feedback
    - Understand
    - Thank the other person
    - Assess

1. One of the team members says something about each item of the CPR model in general and gives personal feedback (if
   needed)
2. The next person summarizes what the previous person said in the general part
3. If the previous person doesn't agree, he/she can correct the other person
4. Then the person that summarized goes on with step 1
5. Finally, the first person summarizes what the last person said in the general part
