In italics, you will find some additional explanations of the agenda points. You will find mostly the same points in the
next agendas.

# Opening

*Here you check that everybody is present.*\
Everyone gives a small summary of the activities in which they participated the previous week.

# Approval of the agenda

*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action

*The items below are things you should look into after the meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of)
the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*

* Distribute issues for the following week.

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)

*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should
implement.*

# Any other business

*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2),
he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA

*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask
them then.*

* What was Sebastian talking about when he said that it is a problem if we parse json into string because that is what
  json parsers do. If we aren't supposed to do that what should we do instead?
* Is it sufficient to write tests for the controller in the manner shown in QueoteControllerTest or if we should do
  integration tests with mock API?

# Question round

*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing

*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
